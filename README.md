# **Chatbot-with-OpenAI**
This repository contains a simple chatbot application built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The chatbot accepts user input, processes it using OpenAI's ChatCompletion API, and generates conversational responses. The project demonstrates basic usage of the OpenAI Python library for conversational AI.
## Features
- Text-based chat interface
- Lightweight and easy to set up
- Utilizes OpenAI's ChatCompletion API for intelligent responses

## Future Steps
- **Integrate with a Database**: Enhance the chatbot by connecting it to a database, allowing it to store and retrieve information dynamically.
- **Add User Authentication**: Implement a system to differentiate user sessions and provide personalized responses.
- **Web Interface**: Create a web-based interface using Flask or Django for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Allow the chatbot to access external knowledge bases or APIs for more comprehensive responses.
